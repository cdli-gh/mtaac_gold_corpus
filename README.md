## Description

In this repository is the annotation gold corpus for the MTAAC project.

At this time it contains morphologically annotated texts and a pseudo-CoNLL-U version of the ETCSRI corpus.

ETCSRI is developed at the Department of Assyriology and Hebrew Studies (Institute of Ancient Studies, Eötvös L. University, Budapest) by Gábor Zólyomi as part of The Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus with the continuous assistance and help of Steve Tinney. It can be cited as :
 Zólyomi, Gábor - Tanos, Bálint - Sövegjártó, Szilvia. The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Royal Inscriptions. 2008-. http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/etcsri/index.html

 Derived data of the ETCSRI corpus, such as the train_morph.conll file, is released to the public domain just like the rest of the content if this repository.

## train_morph.conll preparation
